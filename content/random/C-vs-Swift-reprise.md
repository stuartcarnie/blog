Upgrading the Swift 1.2 version of the orbitals project brought some new performance challenges. 

I revisit a post by David Steuber, which benchmarked C and Swift generating a 2880x2880 pixel Mandelbrot with 4000 iterations per pixel. C killed Swift.

In [C vs Swift 1.2][post], David concludes

{{< blockquote author="David Steuber" >}}
The major take away on this is that Swift is not C or C++. For high performance computing, code has to be structured differently.

David acknowledges the Swift version is quite different from the C implemetation, which allocates an array _for each pixel_. Worse still, this array grows dynamically as it iterates 4000 times, per pixel.

### Baseline

The C version will serve as our baseline. Using `-Ofast`<sup id="fnref:1">[1](#fn:1)</sup> it completed in about 20.5 seconds.

### Swift

I restructured the Swift code so it was semantically equivalent to the C implementation, meaning that it used fixed arrays and a single core. Using the default compiler optimizations, it completed in just under 43 seconds.

```

Enabling `-whole-module-optimization` dropped the runtime to 37.5 seconds. Adding `-Ounchecked` reduced it a further 9 seconds to complete in 28.5 seconds.
