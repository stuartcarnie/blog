A brief exploration how far computing has come by comparing a Cray 1 supercomputer with an iPhone 6

<!--more-->

In the left corner, we have **iPhone 6**

*   2014, 1GB RAM, 115 GFLOPS, 0.129 kgs, 0.5W under heavy usage, $749

In the right corner, we have **Cray-1**

*   1975, 64-bit, 1MB RAM, 0.080 GFLOPS, 4990 kgs, 115KW power, $8,000.000

1 **iPhone 6**, when comparing GFLOPS is roughly equivalent to

*   1437 Cray-1 supercomputers
*   consuming 165MW of power
*   in Arizona, that would power about [20,320 homes][1]
*   costing $11,496,000,000 (not accounting for inflation)
*   weighing 7,170,630 kgs
*   that is over 55 million iPhone 6s
